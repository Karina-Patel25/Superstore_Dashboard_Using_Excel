## **4 Summary of limitations/challenges faced** 

* **Lack of Sub-Categorization:** The current data lacks sub-categorization within the main categories. For example, "Food and Beverages" can include a wide array of products, such as groceries, beverages, snacks, or specialized dietary items. Without sub-categories, it's challenging to pinpoint which specific products are driving sales within this broad category.

* **Short-Term Dataset:** The dataset focuses on a limited timeframe of three months, specifically covering the months of January, February, and March.
